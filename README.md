This repository contains data analysis projects stored as notebooks created with Jupyter Notebook.

## [Exploratory Data Analysis in Python][html_EDA]
[Open notebook][html_EDA]

This notebook illustrates the process of exploratory data analysis with Jupyter Notebook using Python. A sample dataset from the seaborn package is analyzed using a systematic approach to visualize the distribution of variables and associations between variables. This approach can be applied to any other dataset containing similar types of variables.
