# Data Analysis Portfolio
This repository contains data analysis projects stored as Jupyter Notebooks.

## Exploratory Data Analysis in Python
This [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/patrickwfitzgerald/portfolio/blob/master/exploratory-data-analysis-python/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20in%20Python.ipynb) illustrates the process of exploratory data analysis with Jupyter Notebook using Python. A sample dataset from the seaborn package is analyzed using a systematic approach to visualize the distribution of variables and associations between variables. This approach can be applied to any other dataset containing similar types of variables.

## Ecological Footprint and Human Development Index 2016
