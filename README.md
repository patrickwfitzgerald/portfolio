# Data Analysis Portfolio
This repository contains data analysis projects stored as Jupyter Notebooks.

## Exploratory Data Analysis in Python
Open notebook: [html][html_EDA], [nbviewer][nbviewer_EDA], [GitHub][GitHub_EDA]

This notebook illustrates the process of exploratory data analysis with Jupyter Notebook using Python. A sample dataset from the seaborn package is analyzed using a systematic approach to visualize the distribution of variables and associations between variables. This approach can be applied to any other dataset containing similar types of variables.

## Ecological Footprint and Human Development Index
Open notebook: [html][html_EF], [nbviewer][nbviewer_EF], [GitHub][GitHub_EF]

This notebook analyzes the ecological footprint of countries worldwide in relation to their score on the Human Development Index. Data is imported through the Global Footprint Network API and merged with other data sources for the analysis.
